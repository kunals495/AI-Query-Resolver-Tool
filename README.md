# AI-Query-Resolver-Tool

‚òÄÔ∏èOverview :
This repository contains the development of my college major project‚Äîa AI Article Based Query Resolver Tool designed for efficient literature analysis. The system enables users to query documents such as research papers, articles, and web pages to retrieve precise, contextually relevant answers grounded in verifiable sources.
The project is a work-in-progress, and this repository will be updated regularly as new features and optimizations are added. Below is a detailed explanation of the features, workflow, and technologies employed.

üíªTech Stack :
Python Environment
Python 3.8 or higher
Development Tools
IDE: PyCharm (for primary development)
Notebook: Jupyter Notebook (for model experimentation and prototyping)
Key Libraries and Frameworks
LangChain: To manage and chain LLM interactions.
Hugging Face Transformers: For pre-trained models and tokenizers.
FAISS: For efficient similarity search and vector storage.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive web-based UI.
API Keys and Services
Google Gemini API: Integrates advanced language understanding and multimodal capabilities.

üïõInstallation & Usage :

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git  
cd project-repo

3. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed, then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Application
Launch the Streamlit application using the following command:
streamlit run app.py
